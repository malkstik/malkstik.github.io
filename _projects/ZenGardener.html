<h1>ME 507 term project.</h1>
<br/>
A Zen Garden is an arrangement of rocks and gravel meant to inspire reflection and provide the viewer with a sense of calm. Typically, a rake is used to organize the gravel or sand into patterns which highlight the other natural elements in the garden. This process of raking is time consuming and isnâ€™t guaranteed to yield desirable results, thus reducing the value of a Zen Garden to the average consumer. <br/>
<br/>
The objective of our project was to eliminate these minor inconveniences by designing and building an automated Zen Garden. This would allow the consumer to simply input a desired garden design and let the product do the rest. Our Zen Garden minimizes the amount of time required from the user and eliminates any user error, all while maintaining the calming and satisfying effects of a manual Zen Garden. <br/>
