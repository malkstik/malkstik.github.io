A full working demonstration was not recorded, but the two key functions that lead to it were. The following two recordings are for pick and place and block detection. 
Pick and place demonstrates the robot's ability to sense its current pose and solve the inverse kinematics to move to a desired pose. Block detection which 
demonstrates the robot's ability to sense the world and decide what to do from there.
