Drake is an extremely powerful tool as a simulator and for designing controls algorithms. In this project, the goal is to familiarize 
myself with this tool. In doing so, I would like to also become more comfortable with quaternion dynamics, a much more robust alternative to
euler angles. As of now, I have managed to put together a working model of a quadcopter using quaternions for orientation representations, built an LQR
controller for this model, and written a working iLQR controller for stabilizing a car's trajectory onto a cicular path. The next step is to connect what
I learned from building both of these controllers to build an iLQR controller for a quadcopter.
