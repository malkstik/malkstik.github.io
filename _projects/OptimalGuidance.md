title: "AEROSP584: Optimal Guidance Approximation"
excerpt: "The optimal guidance law for missile pursuit involves solving an optimization that can be computationally expensive. This implementation makes use of motion primitives to approximate the behavior of the optimal guidance law for a 2D evader-pursuer scenario in MATLAB. This project was completed for AEROSP584:Navigation and Guidance from Perception to Control at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor."
