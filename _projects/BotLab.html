A full working demo for this project was not recorded; however, some necessary intermediate functionality was recorded.

<h2> Waypoint following (no SLAM): </h2>

<h2> SLAM: </h2>
This image displays a map generated using log odds scoring of an occupancy grid map for the same obstacle course as in the waypoint following demonstration. 
The straight green lines connect waypoints but were not required to be traveled along. The curvy green line is the path measured by just wheel encoders. The curvy
purple line shows the output of a particle filter which considers the robots dynamics, the odometry, and the map.
