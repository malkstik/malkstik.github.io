title: "Robot Arm Optical Coherence Tomography Motion Planning "
excerpt: "**Relevant skills: ROS, MoveIt, Klamp't, C++, Python, Path Planning**  
The Image Guided Medical Robotics (IGMR) Lab at the University of Michigan is interested in developing a device that can autonomously manipulate an optical coherence tomographer (OCT) to image retinas. I work with industry standard frameworks, such as ROS2 and MoveIt, to implement the motion planning for this project."
