title: "Hydraulically Powered Exo"
excerpt: "**Relevant skills:  Model Matching, Arduino, Python, Embedded Control, Kalman Filter**  \
The UCSF BioRobotics lab is interested in determining the efficacy of robot powered exoskeletons and prosthetics in the application of physical therapy. To study the instruments' effects, patients will be instructed to perform certain tasks while undergoing a magnetoencephalography. This project goes over the design of an exo compatible with such magnetically sensitive equipment."
