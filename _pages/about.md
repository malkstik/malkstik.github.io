Hello! I am currently a master's student at the University of Michigan studying Robotics. I completed a Bacherlor's of Science at Cal Poly SLO in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in mechatronics.

My areas of focus are in control, motion planning, and state estimation.

In my spare time, I like to spend time with my two cats, Tsu and Ina. I also enjoy racket sports, gaming, going to the gym, and cooking.
