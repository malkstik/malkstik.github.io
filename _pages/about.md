Hello! I am currently a Control Software Engineer at the Brembo Coding Hub, working on [Sensify.](https://www.sensify.brembo.com/)

I received my master's in robotics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. There, I contributed to research in the [Image-Guided Medical Robotics Lab](https://medical.robotics.umich.edu/), working on motion planning for robotic optical coherence tomography.

My areas of focus are in control, motion planning, and state estimation. My current home project is building out a quadcopter controller using Drake in python. You can read more about it [here](https://malkstik.github.io/projects/1_QuadcopterControl).

In my spare time I like to spend time with my cats. I also enjoy racket sports, gaming, going to the gym, and cooking.
